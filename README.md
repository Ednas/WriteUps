[Immersive Labs](https://www.immersivelabs.com/) offers a free account available to students. Taking advantage of this, I've completed quite a few of their labs. 

## NICE Challenge

The [NICE Challenge](https://nice-challenge.com/) Project develops real-world cybersecurity challenges within virtualized business environments that bring students the workforce experience before the workforce. Our goal is to provide the most realistic experiences to students, at-scale year-round, while also generating useful assessment data about their knowledge, skills, and abilities for educators.
