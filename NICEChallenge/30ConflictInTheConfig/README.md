## Meeting Briefing

![Meeting Info 2](./images/meeting2.PNG)

**Jacqueline Smith**
Who can I talk to regarding an issue with the company website?

**Ricardo Cortes**
I'm pretty sure @asteele would be the person to talk to about that.

**Ashley Steele**
Hey, @jsmith, what seems to be the problem?

**Jacqueline Smith**
I've had multiple customers complain about having to come into the store because they were unable to make purchases online due to extremely long load times.

**Ricardo Cortes**
That's pretty concerning. Is there anything else the customers have shared with you?

**Jacqueline Smith**
Just that the issue seems to be exacerbated during peak hours.

**Ricardo Cortes**
@asteele, are you available to work on this right now?

**Ashley Steele**
Actually, no. I'm pretty swamped with implementing that new ticketing system that the support staff is so eager for.

**Ricardo Cortes**
Do you know of anyone else that might have the knowledge to investigate the situation?

**Ashley Steele**
@playerone should have no problem taking this on. How about it, @playerone? Check out what's running on Prod-Joomla. There has to be some process that's running inefficiently or something.

**Jacqueline Smith**
That sounds great. Please hurry and figure out what's causing the website to be so sluggish during peak hours. Time is money!
