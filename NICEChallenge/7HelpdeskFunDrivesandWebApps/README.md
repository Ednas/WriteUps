### Scenario
You have been busy as DAS Webs Inc.'s new help desk personnel. Today you have been assigned two troubleshooting issues:

1. Sergio Chanel recently put in a requisition for a new small internal hard drive so he could store any intermediate employee performance reports and other performance data before they are committed to the company HR file share. He requested that this drive be mapped with a drive letter of R. He reports that the drive worked initially but became slow. He explained that he "fiddled" with some settings in the hope that he could fix the general sluggishness. He was hoping that he would be able to avoid asking for help, but now, for some reason, the drive no longer shows up at all. Help him fix this issue.

2. Sergio Chanel needs to change some contact information for an employee that just moved to a satellite branch of DAS Webs. Sergio tried to log into Ledger SMB to record the changes. However, when navigating to the LedgerSMB web page he reported an error. Please restore functionality to LedgerSMB again.
